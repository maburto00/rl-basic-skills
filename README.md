RL Basic Skills

I will implement here whatever I feel is important for me to do research in RL. These includes: graphs, state-of-the-art algorithms, usage of RL libraries, solving ALE, OpenAI tasks (with the most appropiate method), etc.

- TODO: Graphs for performance over different algorithms
- TF Agents library
- Distributional RL
- Contextual Bandits
